cd tdd-intro
npm ci
npm test
```

## Topics to understand

- Test First Development
- Difference between Test First Development and Test Driven Development
- Red, green, refactor

## Rules of TDD

- Write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass.

## Tips

- Run the tests in watch mode
```npm test -- --watch```
- Validate that your coverage is over 80%
