Construction.
For example: r = new Range(0,10) // modify to fit your language's syntax
Checking whether an integer lies in the range.
What name do you think is appropriate?
Intersection of two ranges, creating a new range consisting of all integers that are in both ranges.
For example, the intersection of range [0..3] (numbers 0, 1, 2 & 3) and range [2..4] is the range [2..3]
What do you think should happen if the intersection is empty?
